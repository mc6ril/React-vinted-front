Welcome to M.Moustache. This is a __small replica__ from the original website : https://www.m-moustache.com/fr/homme.
The origin of this was a project during my last formation into the Reacteur in Paris. 
The project was to create a website, calling an __API__ made by oursalves in order to __create new stuffs to add into the basket, and add a payment feature using Stripe.
This website is subject to modification to implement new pages and build a real replica.__

All __feedback is always welcome__ as it is one of my first react project !
